# MathBlocks Primes Artwork

You can use this repository to easily access the images that are generated by the MathBlocks Primes smart contract.

- `svg/`: holds the SVG files that are returned by the tokenURI function.
- `jpg/`: we rendered the SVG files into JPEGs for your convenience.

Note the the JPEG files are static as opposed to the original SVG files which are animated.
